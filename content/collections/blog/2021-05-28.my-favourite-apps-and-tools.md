title: 'My favourite apps and tools for MacOS'
excerpt: 'I work as a web developer five days a week and therefore spend a lot of time using MacOS. I''m a fan of the operating system and will happily sing its praises; however, my satisfaction very much relies on my favourite third party apps and tools that help make things that little bit easier.'

Since 2009, Windows 7 users have been able to easily resize windows via a simple drag and drop function. Frustratingly, this was always something that I felt MacOS lacked, but thankfully, Spectacle fills in the gap. It''s not the only app out there for the job, but it certainly does the job.'
