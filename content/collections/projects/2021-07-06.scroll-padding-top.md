        text: 'This CSS property would''ve made my early days as a developer a whole lot easier. There were many times where I attempted to create a snazzy one-page-site, using the href attribute to scroll certain sections into view but would end up with the section hidden beneath my fixed header. I''d fiddle with the positioning of my ID but came to accept that JavaScript was the solution.'

        text: 'However, the scroll-padding property fixes this by allowing the user to define an offset for when child elements are scrolled into view. The scroll can be triggered by both href=''#'' and the JS scrollIntoView function.'
